Use DMZ 
 
DMZ / demilitarized zone is a perimeter network that protects and adds an extra layer of security to an organization’s internal local-area network from untrusted traffic.

DMZ networks have been central to securing global enterprise networks since the introduction of firewalls. They protect organizations’ sensitive data, systems, and resources by keeping internal networks separate from systems that could be targeted by attackers. DMZs also enable organizations to control and reduce access levels to sensitive systems.

Enterprises are increasingly using containers and virtual machines (VMs) to isolate their networks or particular applications from the rest of their systems. The growth of the cloud means many businesses no longer need internal web servers. They have also migrated much of their external infrastructure to the cloud by using Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications. 

For example, a cloud service like Microsoft Azure allows an organization that runs applications on-premises and on virtual private networks (VPNs) to use a hybrid approach with the DMZ sitting between both. This method can also be used when outgoing traffic needs auditing or to control traffic between an on-premises data center and virtual networks.

Further, DMZs are proving useful in countering the security risks posed by new technology such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and operational technology (OT) systems, which make production and manufacturing smarter but create a vast threat surface. That is because OT equipment has not been designed to cope with or recover from cyberattacks the way that IoT digital devices have been, which presents a substantial risk to organizations’ critical data and resources. A DMZ provides network segmentation to lower the risk of an attack that can cause damage to industrial infrastructure
